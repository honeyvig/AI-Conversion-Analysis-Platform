# AI-Conversion-Analysis-Platform
To build a conversation analysis platform using AI, we will focus on several core areas, including natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and conversational flow analysis. Here's a breakdown of the solution along with the Python code for building a conversation analysis platform.
Core Features of the Conversation Analysis Platform

    Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization.
    Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of the conversation.
    Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify entities like names, dates, locations in conversations.
    Topic Modeling: Detect topics being discussed in a conversation.
    Conversation Flow: Track the structure and flow of conversations over time (e.g., turn-taking, conversation length).
    Visual Analytics: Provide visualizations of conversation data such as sentiment trends, word clouds, etc.

We'll use popular Python libraries such as spaCy, nltk, transformers, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to implement these features.
Step-by-Step Python Code
1. Install Required Libraries

pip install spacy transformers scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

2. Text Preprocessing & NLP Tasks

We will start with text preprocessing, tokenization, stop word removal, and named entity recognition (NER).

import spacy
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from spacy import displacy
import re
import string

# Load spaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Download NLTK stopwords
nltk.download("stopwords")
stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))

# Preprocessing function
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove special characters and digits
    text = re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", text)
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Tokenize and remove stop words
    tokens = text.split()
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    return " ".join(tokens)

# Named Entity Recognition (NER) function
def extract_entities(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    entities = [(entity.text, entity.label_) for entity in doc.ents]
    return entities

# Example text
sample_text = "John Doe scheduled a meeting for tomorrow at 3 PM in New York."
cleaned_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)
entities = extract_entities(sample_text)

print(f"Cleaned Text: {cleaned_text}")
print(f"Entities: {entities}")

3. Sentiment Analysis

For sentiment analysis, we'll use Hugging Face's transformers library with a pre-trained model.

from transformers import pipeline

# Load sentiment analysis model
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Sentiment analysis function
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)
    return result[0]['label'], result[0]['score']

# Example text
sentiment, confidence = analyze_sentiment("I love the new features of the platform!")
print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}, Confidence: {confidence}")

4. Topic Modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

We'll use sklearn for topic modeling based on LDA.

from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Example conversation data
documents = [
    "I love the new features of the platform. The interface is fantastic.",
    "The customer support is very responsive. I'm really happy with the service.",
    "I think the platform could improve in terms of speed. It can be a bit slow sometimes."
]

# Vectorize the text data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Perform LDA topic modeling
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=2, random_state=42)
lda.fit(X)

# Get the topics
def print_topics(model, vectorizer, top_n=5):
    terms = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
    for idx, topic in enumerate(model.components_):
        print(f"Topic #{idx + 1}:")
        print([terms[i] for i in topic.argsort()[-top_n:]])

# Display the topics
print_topics(lda, vectorizer)

5. Conversation Flow Analysis

To analyze the flow of conversation (e.g., turn-taking, sentence length), we can track the length of each response and the timing of replies.

import time

# Simulate conversation turns
conversation = [
    {"speaker": "Agent", "text": "Hello, how can I help you today?"},
    {"speaker": "Customer", "text": "I need help with my order."},
    {"speaker": "Agent", "text": "Sure! Can you please provide your order number?"}
]

# Track the flow and response times
def analyze_conversation_flow(conversation):
    last_time = time.time()
    for turn in conversation:
        response_time = time.time() - last_time
        last_time = time.time()
        print(f"{turn['speaker']} says: {turn['text']}")
        print(f"Response time: {response_time:.2f} seconds\n")

analyze_conversation_flow(conversation)

6. Visual Analytics (Word Cloud and Sentiment Trends)

We can use matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations of the analysis results.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Word Cloud for conversation
def generate_word_cloud(text):
    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400).generate(text)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# Example text for word cloud
text_for_cloud = " ".join([turn['text'] for turn in conversation])
generate_word_cloud(text_for_cloud)

7. Full Conversation Analysis Pipeline

You can combine these functions into a comprehensive conversation analysis pipeline that includes preprocessing, sentiment analysis, NER, topic modeling, and conversation flow analysis.

def analyze_conversation(conversation):
    for turn in conversation:
        cleaned_text = preprocess_text(turn['text'])
        sentiment, confidence = analyze_sentiment(turn['text'])
        entities = extract_entities(turn['text'])
        
        print(f"{turn['speaker']} says: {turn['text']}")
        print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}")
        print(f"Entities: {entities}")
        print("-" * 50)

# Example conversation
conversation = [
    {"speaker": "Agent", "text": "Hello, how can I assist you today?"},
    {"speaker": "Customer", "text": "I want to check my order status."},
    {"speaker": "Agent", "text": "Sure, may I have your order ID?"}
]

analyze_conversation(conversation)

Summary of Features:

    Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text, removes stop words.
    Sentiment Analysis: Determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each conversation turn.
    Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies entities like names, dates, and locations.
    Topic Modeling (LDA): Identifies topics discussed in the conversation using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
    Conversation Flow Analysis: Tracks the flow of conversation and response times.
    Visual Analytics: Generates word clouds to visualize commonly used words and trends.

Conclusion:

This Python code provides a foundation for building a conversation analysis platform that can process and analyze conversations in real-time. It combines various NLP techniques and tools to provide insights such as sentiment, named entities, and topics being discussed. Additionally, visualizations like word clouds and response time analysis are included to further enhance the user experience.

If you'd like to expand this further, you can add more advanced features such as chatbot response generation, intent classification, or even deeper conversational analytics using deep learning models.
